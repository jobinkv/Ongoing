# Abstract
+ This article explores the application of various deep features in document image analysis problems such as document image classification, script identiication, writer varification and from the the book cover image, identiy the genre of the book.
+ We propose a novel network architecture to explore the advantages of both texture and global deep features in the above mensioned problems.
+ In oder to evaluate the proposed architecture, we conduct a numerous experiments with various publically available dataset and achived state of the art result in all the problems.
